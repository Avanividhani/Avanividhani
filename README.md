Hi there, I'm Avani Vidhani

Creative Technologist | Immersive Media Designer | XR Developer

I explore the intersection of art, technology, and storytelling - creating immersive experiences through XR, interactive installations, games, and physical computing.
Currently pursuing a Master’s in Expanded Media and always experimenting with how technology can shape new forms of expression.

What I Do

Interactive Installations – bridging software, hardware & design for spaces like Museums, Expos, Exhibition, Live show, Trade Show and more.
XR Development – AR/VR applications, games, and immersive storytelling
