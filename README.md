Hi there, I'm Avani Vidhani

Creative Technologist | Immersive Media Designer | XR Developer

I explore the intersection of art, technology, and storytelling -
creating immersive experiences through XR, interactive installations, 
games, and physical computing.

Currently pursuing a Master’s in Expanded Media and always experimenting 
with how technology can shape new forms of expression.


[ WHAT I DO ]

- Interactive Installations 
  bridging software, hardware & design for spaces like 
  Museums, Expos, Exhibitions, Live Shows, Trade Shows and more.

- XR Development 
  AR/VR applications, games, and immersive storytelling
